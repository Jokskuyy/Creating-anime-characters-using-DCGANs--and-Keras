# Anime Character Generation with DCGANs and Keras 🎉

Welcome to a project that combines cutting-edge AI with creativity! This project uses Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs) to generate unique anime character images, harnessing the power of neural networks to bring art and data science together.

---

## Project Overview 📜

This DCGAN model uses two networks—the Generator and the Discriminator—to create realistic anime-style characters. The Generator learns to produce believable images, while the Discriminator judges their authenticity, leading to increasingly refined results. By training on anime datasets, this model captures distinct features and generates character images that mirror real anime art.

## Learning Objectives 🎯

This project serves as a practical assignment for students enrolled in IBM Academy’s Advanced AI Program. Through implementing this DCGAN model in Keras, participants gain hands-on experience in GAN-based image generation.
